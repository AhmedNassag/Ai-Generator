 * @@Name@@Controller Class

 * This controller is responsible for handling all @@Name@@-related actions, such as creating, reading, updating,
 * and deleting @@Name@@ records. It extends the BaseController to leverage generic CRUD functionality, ensuring
 * a consistent and maintainable code structure. The @@Name@@Controller relies on the @@Name@@Service to manage
 * @@Name@@-specific business logic and interactions with the data layer.
 *
 * By extending the BaseController, this class benefits from pre-defined methods for handling HTTP requests,
 * error handling, and standardized response formatting. This promotes reusability and reduces code duplication
 * across different controllers in the application.
